The citizenship test already changed in late 2025. In 2026 there is no additional change scheduled. What matters is which version you take based on when you filed your application.

## Short Answer

The civics test was updated effective October 20, 2025. If you file Form N-400 on or after that date, you take the new 2025 test (128 questions, 20 asked, 12 correct to pass). If you filed before that date, you take the 2008 test (100 questions, 10 asked, 6 correct to pass). In 2026, both versions are still in use depending on your filing date.

## What Changed and When?

USCIS rolled out the 2025 naturalization civics test for everyone who files Form N-400 (Application for Naturalization) on or after October 20, 2025. The change is tied to your **filing date**, not the year you take the test. So if you are taking the test in 2026, you are either under the old rules (2008 test) or the new rules (2025 test) based on when you submitted your N-400.

## Which Test Do I Take in 2026?

Use your N-400 filing date:

- **Filed before Oct. 20, 2025:** You take the 2008 civics test (100-question bank, up to 10 asked, 6 correct to pass).
- **Filed on or after Oct. 20, 2025:** You take the 2025 civics test (128-question bank, up to 20 asked, 12 correct to pass).

There is no separate "2026 test." The version you get in 2026 is determined only by this rule.

## What's Different on the 2025 Test?

The 2025 test has a larger question bank (128 instead of 100), more questions asked at the interview (20 instead of 10), and a higher passing bar (12 correct instead of 6). Both represent 60% correct. Some questions and accepted answers also changed. For example, the 2008 test asks for **three** of the 13 original states; the 2025 test asks for **five**. Study the official list for your version so you know the exact wording and answers.

## How to Prepare

First confirm which test applies to you using your N-400 filing date. Then study the official questions and practice answering out loud. Citizenry offers mock interviews and study tools for both the 2008 and 2025 tests, so you can practice the right format and build confidence before your interview.
