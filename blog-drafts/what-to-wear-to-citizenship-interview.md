There is no official USCIS dress code for the citizenship interview, but business casual attire is recommended. Wear clean, neat clothing such as khakis and a collared shirt, a blouse with dress pants, or a modest dress. While your outfit will not determine whether you pass or fail, dressing appropriately shows respect for the process and can help you feel more confident during the [naturalization interview](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/the-naturalization-interview-and-test).

## What Does Business Casual Mean?

Business casual is the level of formality you would use for a job interview or an important meeting. For the citizenship interview, good options include:

- Dress pants or khakis with a collared shirt or blouse
- A skirt or slacks with a neat top
- A modest dress
- A suit or blazer (appropriate but not required)
- Clean, closed-toe shoes

## What Not to Wear

Avoid overly casual clothing that could give the impression you have not taken the interview seriously. Items to leave at home include:

- Shorts or athletic wear
- Flip-flops or sandals
- Ripped or distressed jeans
- Tank tops or clothing with large logos or slogans
- Hats or sunglasses (remove these before entering the USCIS office)

## Does What You Wear Affect Your Interview?

Your clothing will not directly determine whether your [application](https://www.uscis.gov/n-400) is approved or denied. According to [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/the-naturalization-interview-and-test), officers evaluate your eligibility based on your N-400 application, your English ability, and your knowledge of U.S. civics. However, first impressions are inevitable. Dressing neatly signals that you have prepared, that you understand the significance of the interview, and that you are taking the process seriously.

## Comfort Matters Too

Your citizenship interview typically lasts 20 to 30 minutes, and you may spend additional time in the waiting room before your appointment. Choose clothing that is comfortable enough for sitting and waiting. If you are more comfortable in formal attire, wear it. If business casual feels more natural, that works just as well. The goal is to look neat and feel confident so you can focus on the questions rather than your outfit.

## Tips for Interview Day

1. Lay out your clothes the night before so you are not rushing in the morning
2. Make sure your outfit is clean and pressed
3. Bring a light jacket or sweater in case the USCIS office is cold
4. Remove hats and sunglasses before entering the building
5. Turn off your phone before your name is called

## Focus Your Preparation on What Matters Most

What you wear is just one small part of the interview. The questions you will be asked about U.S. history, government, and your N-400 application are what determine whether you pass. Practice answering civics questions out loud and review your N-400 form so you can respond confidently. Citizenry's unlimited mock interviews let you simulate the full USCIS interview experience so the real thing feels familiar.
