Many apps can help you prepare for the US citizenship test. The best one for you depends on which test version you take, how you like to study, and whether you want features like mock interviews or multiple languages. Here is what to look for and where to find detailed comparisons.

## What to Look for in a Citizenship Test App

Not all apps are the same. When you evaluate options, consider these factors:

- **Mock interviews:** The civics test is an oral interview, not a written exam. Some apps let you practice speaking answers to a virtual interviewer; others only offer flashcards or multiple-choice quizzes. If you get nervous speaking in front of an officer, an app with mock interviews may help.
- **Test version (2008 vs 2025):** If you filed Form N-400 on or after October 20, 2025, you take the 2025 test (128 questions, 12 of 20 correct to pass). If you filed before that date, you take the 2008 test (100 questions, 6 of 10 correct). Not every app supports both versions.
- **Ads:** Some apps are free but show ads. Others are free with no ads, or offer a paid tier to remove ads. Your preference may depend on how much you mind interruptions while studying.
- **Study modes:** Look for a mix that works for you: flashcards, quizzes, audio, and (if available) oral practice.
- **Languages:** If you prefer to study in a language other than English, check whether the app supports your language.

## The Official USCIS App

USCIS offers a free civics study app. It covers the 2008 civics test (100 questions), has no ads, and is completely free. As of this writing, it does not include the 2025 test (128 questions) and does not offer mock interviews. It can still be a useful starting point if you are on the 2008 test and only need basic question-and-answer study. For a detailed feature-by-feature comparison of the official app with other options, see our [Citizenry vs Official USCIS App](/compare/citizenry-vs-uscis-app.html) comparison page.

## Other Citizenship Test Apps

Several third-party apps cover the civics test. Features vary: some support both the 2008 and 2025 tests, some include mock interviews or speech practice, and some are ad-supported unless you pay. To compare options side by side, we maintain a [Compare citizenship test apps](/compare/) section with full comparisons. There you can read [Citizenry vs Citizen Now](/compare/citizenry-vs-citizen-now.html) and [Citizenry vs Official USCIS App](/compare/citizenry-vs-uscis-app.html), which break down features, pricing, and who might prefer each app.

## Match the App to Your Test Version

Before you commit to an app, confirm which civics test you will take. Use your N-400 filing date: filed on or after October 20, 2025 means the 2025 test; filed before that means the 2008 test. Choosing an app that supports your version ensures you study the right questions and passing rules.

## How to Decide

There is no single "best" app for everyone. The best app for you is one that supports your test version, your preferred language, and offers the study style you need. If you want to practice the oral interview format, Citizenry is currently the only app that offers mock interviews and study tools for both test versions. You can see how it compares to the official USCIS app and other alternatives on our [Compare](/compare/) page.
