If you are searching for citizenship test questions for 2026, the set you need depends on when you filed (or will file) your N-400. There is no separate "2026 test." Here is how to find the right questions and prepare.

## Which Questions Apply in 2026?

USCIS ties your civics test to your **N-400 filing date**, not the year you take the interview. So in 2026 you will take one of two versions:

- **Filed before October 20, 2025:** You take the **2008 test.** Study the **100** official civics questions. The officer asks up to 10; you need 6 correct to pass.
- **Filed on or after October 20, 2025:** You take the **2025 test.** Study the **128** official civics questions. The officer asks up to 20; you need 12 correct to pass.

If your interview is in 2026, use your filing date above to know which question set to study.

## 65/20 Special Consideration

If you are 65 or older and have been a lawful permanent resident for at least 20 years when you file, you get a smaller set. You study **20 specially designated questions** and are asked **10** at the interview; you need **6 correct** to pass. Which 20 questions you get (2008 or 2025 style) still depends on your N-400 filing date.

## How the Test Works

The civics test is **oral.** The officer asks questions from the official bank and you answer out loud. The officer stops once you reach the passing number of correct answers or the failing number of incorrect answers. Practicing with the exact question set for your version and answering out loud is the best way to prepare.

## How to Prepare

Confirm which test version applies to you using your N-400 filing date, then study that question set and practice answering out loud. Citizenry includes the full 128-question 2025 set and the 100-question 2008 set, plus mock interviews for both, so you can practice the right questions and format until you are ready for your 2026 interview.
