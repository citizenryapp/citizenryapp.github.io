Choosing the right study materials can make the difference between feeling nervous and feeling confident on test day. Here are the best study guides and resources available for the US citizenship test, starting with the official USCIS materials.

## Official USCIS Study Materials (Free)

USCIS provides free study materials through their Citizenship Resource Center at uscis.gov. These are the authoritative source for all test content:

- 128 Civics Test Questions and Answers - the complete official question bank for the 2025 test
- 100 Civics Questions and Answers — the complete question bank for the 2008 test
- "One Nation, One People" — the official 2025 study guide
- Civics Flash Cards (cut-out)
- A four-part video series on the naturalization interview and test

## Know Which Test Version You're Taking

Before you start studying, confirm which test version applies to you. If you filed your N-400 on or after October 20, 2025, you'll take the 2025 test. The USCIS officer will ask up to 20 questions from a pool of 128, and you must answer at least 12 correctly to pass. If you filed before that date, you may take the 2008 test, where you're asked up to 10 questions from a pool of 100 and need 6 correct. The two tests overlap significantly, but the 2025 version adds new questions covering topics like the Electoral College, documents that influenced the Constitution, and reasons the US entered specific wars.

## Check for Answer Updates

Some civics answers change due to elections or appointments. USCIS instructs applicants to visit uscis.gov/citizenship/testupdates before their interview to verify current answers.

## Build a Study Routine

Create a simple, consistent study routine that fits into your daily life. Most importantly, practice speaking your answers out loud because the citizenship test is an oral interview. Citizenry offers everything in one place: study guides based on the official USCIS civics questions, quizzes, flashcards, and unlimited mock interviews that simulate the real naturalization interview.
