If you are preparing for U.S. citizenship in 2026, the number of civics questions depends on your N-400 filing date.

## Which Test Applies in 2026?

**Important** USCIS ties your civics test version to when you filed Form N-400, *not* the day you actually take the test:

- **Filed before Oct. 20, 2025:** 2008 civics test (100-question bank, up to 10 asked, 6 correct to pass)
- **Filed on or after Oct. 20, 2025:** 2025 civics test (128-question bank, up to 20 asked, 12 correct to pass)

This means some people taking the test in 2026 will be taking the 2008 civics test version, and others will be taking the 2025 version. It all depends on when you filed your Form N-400.

## Side-by-Side: 2008 vs 2025 Civics Test

Here is the simplest comparison:

- **2008 test:** 100 total study questions, up to 10 asked, pass with 6 correct
- **2025 test:** 128 total study questions, up to 20 asked, pass with 12 correct
- **Both versions:** Oral interview format with a USCIS officer

USCIS officers stop when you either reach the passing number of correct answers or reach the failing number of incorrect answers.

## What Changed in Question Content?

The 2025 bank is not only larger, it also changes some questions and accepted answers. For example, the 2008 test asks you to name **three** of the 13 original states, while the 2025 test asks for **five**.

## Best Way to Prepare for the Test

For the most accurate prep, make sure you are studying for the correct version of the test and practice in the same oral format USCIS uses. Citizenry lets you practice with mock interviews for both test versions, so you can get comfortable answering out loud and track whether you are consistently hitting the passing score.
