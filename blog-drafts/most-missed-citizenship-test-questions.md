USCIS does not publish statistics on which civics test questions people get wrong most often. That means most lists of "commonly missed questions" online are just guesses. Citizenry is different. Because the app contains every official USCIS question and all of their acceptable answers, and because it tracks how users answer during mock interviews, it can identify exactly which questions trip people up the most. Here are the questions that Citizenry users get wrong most often, and why.

## Concepts That Sound Familiar but Have Specific Answers

**"What is the 'rule of law'?"**

The most common wrong answer is "the Constitution." The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, but that is a different question. The "rule of law" means that everyone must follow the law, leaders must obey the law, government must obey the law, and no one is above the law. Any of those answers is acceptable. People mix up these two concepts because they sound related, but USCIS is looking for a specific idea: no person or group is above the law.

**"What does the judicial branch do?"**

Many people answer "makes laws" or "enforces laws." The judicial branch reviews laws, explains laws, resolves disputes, and decides if a law goes against the Constitution. The key word to remember is "reviews." Congress makes laws, the President enforces them, and the courts review them.

## Questions Where People Confuse Similar Facts

**"The Federalist Papers supported the passage of the U.S. Constitution. Name one of the writers."**

The most common wrong answer is Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, not the Federalist Papers. The correct answers are James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, or Publius (the shared pen name they used).

**"Who makes federal laws?"**

Many people answer "the President." The President signs bills into law, but Congress (the Senate and House of Representatives) makes federal laws. This mix-up happens because the President is the most visible figure in government, but lawmaking power belongs to Congress.

## Numbers That Are Easy to Mix Up

Several civics questions ask for specific numbers, and getting them confused is one of the most common mistakes.

- **435** voting members in the House of Representatives (both test versions)
- **100** U.S. Senators, 2 per state (both test versions)
- **27** amendments to the Constitution (both test versions)
- **9** justices on the Supreme Court (both test versions)
- **5** justices needed to decide a Supreme Court case (2025 test only)

People frequently swap these numbers. For example, they say 50 Senators instead of 100. A helpful trick: there are 50 states and 2 Senators per state, so 50 times 2 equals 100.

## How to Study the Most-Missed Questions

Citizenry includes a curated list of the 25 most-missed questions for each test version (2008 and 2025), based on real mock interview data. Each question is labeled with a miss frequency (high, medium, or low) so you can see at a glance which ones cause the most trouble. No other study resource has the data to make these determinations. Knowing which questions people miss most often, and how frequently they miss them, helps you focus your study time on the areas that matter most.
