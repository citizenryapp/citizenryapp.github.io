Many people wonder if they can take the US citizenship test in their native language. The answer depends on whether you qualify for an English language exception. If you do, you may take the civics test in your language with an interpreter.

## Most Applicants Take the Test in English

For most naturalization applicants, the test is given in English. You must show that you can read, write, speak, and understand basic English, and you take the civics test in English. There is no general option to take the full test in another language unless you meet one of the official exceptions below.

## Who Can Take the Civics Test in Their Own Language?

USCIS allows you to skip the English requirement and take the civics test in your language of choice if you meet one of these age and residency rules at the time you file your N-400:

- **50/20 exception:** You are 50 or older and have been a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) for at least 20 years.
- **55/15 exception:** You are 55 or older and have been a lawful permanent resident for at least 15 years.

If you qualify, you are exempt from the English reading, writing, and speaking parts, but you still must pass the civics test. You may take the civics portion in your native language using an interpreter.

## You Must Bring an Interpreter

If you take the civics test in your language, you must bring your own interpreter to the interview. USCIS does not provide one. Your interpreter can be a friend or relative rather than a paid professional. Your interpreter must be fluent in both English and your native language. Plan this in advance so your interview can proceed smoothly.

## Special Consideration at 65/20

If you are 65 or older and have been a permanent resident for at least 20 years when you file, you get special consideration on the civics test. You still take the civics test (and may use an interpreter if you also meet the 50/20 or 55/15 English exemption), but you study a smaller set of questions. For both the 2008 and 2025 tests, you study 20 specially designated questions and are asked 10. You need to answer 6 of 10 correctly to pass.

The table below summarizes how the citizenship test for seniors under the 65/20 rule differs from the standard 2008 and 2025 tests.

| Feature | Citizenship Test 2008 Version | Citizenship Test 2025 Version | Senior Exception (65/20) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Questions to study | 100 questions | 128 questions | 20 questions only |
| Test and interview language | English (reading and writing) | English (reading and writing) | Native language |
| Interpreter allowed | Not allowed | Not allowed | Allowed |
| Passing score | 6 out of 10 correct | 12 out of 20 correct | 6 out of 10 correct |

## Medical Disability Exception

If a physical, developmental, or mental disability prevents you from meeting the English or civics requirements, you may qualify for an exception. You submit [Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions](https://www.uscis.gov/n-648), completed by a licensed medical or osteopathic doctor or a licensed clinical psychologist. If approved, USCIS may waive the English requirement, the civics requirement, or both, depending on your situation.

## How to Prepare

Studying the official [USCIS civics questions and answers](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/study-materials-civics-test) and practicing speaking answers out loud are the best ways to prepare for the citizenship test. If you are eligible for the 65/20 special consideration, use the specially designated question list for your test version (2008 or 2025).

Practicing with mock interviews will help you feel confident for the real interview. Citizenry offers unlimited mock interviews so you can practice as many times as you need. And importantly, Citizenry is the only citizenship test study app available in 20 languages, so you can study and practice in English or your native language.
