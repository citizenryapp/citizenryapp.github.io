The number of questions on the U.S. citizenship civics test, and how many you need to answer correctly to pass, depends on which test version you take. USCIS uses two versions: the 2008 test and the 2025 test. Here's the direct answer and how it works.

## The Short Answer

**2008 civics test:** There are 100 questions in the official study list. During your naturalization interview, the officer asks you up to 10 questions from that list. You must answer **at least 6 correctly** to pass the civics portion.

**2025 civics test:** There are 128 questions in the official study list. During your interview, the officer asks you up to 20 questions. You must answer **at least 12 correctly** to pass the civics portion.

## Which Test Do I Take?

Your version is based on when you filed Form N-400 (Application for Naturalization):

- **Filed before October 20, 2025:** You take the **2008 test** (100 questions, need 6 of 10 correct to pass).
- **Filed on or after October 20, 2025:** You take the **2025 test** (128 questions, need 12 of 20 correct to pass).

## How the Civics Test Works

The civics test is given orally at your naturalization interview. The USCIS officer reads questions from the official list; you answer out loud. You don't see the questions on paper. As soon as you reach the required number of correct answers, you pass that part of the test and the officer typically stops asking civics questions.

## 2008 vs 2025: Why Two Versions?

USCIS updated the civics test effective October 20, 2025. The 2025 version has 28 more questions than the 2008 version and covers additional topics in U.S. history and government. The passing requirement is proportional: 6 out of 10 for the 2008 test and 12 out of 20 for the 2025 test both represent 60% correct. If you're unsure which test applies to you, use your N-400 filing date as the deciding factor.

## Special Consideration: 65/20 Rule

If you are 65 or older and have been a lawful permanent resident for at least 20 years, you may qualify for a simpler civics requirement. Under this 65/20 rule, you study fewer questions and need fewer correct answers. The exact number depends on whether you take the 2008 or 2025 test; USCIS has specific guidance for each. If you think you qualify, review citizenship test exemptions or speak with an accredited representative.

## How to Prepare

Study the full list of questions for your test version so you're ready for any that the officer might ask. Practice saying your answers out loud because the test is oral, not written. Mock interviews that simulate the real USCIS experience are one of the most effective ways to build confidence and get used to answering under pressure.

To get ready for the real test, practice with Citizenry's unlimited mock interviews and study tools for both the 2008 and 2025 tests. You can drill all the questions and run through full practice interviews so you know exactly what to expect on test day.
