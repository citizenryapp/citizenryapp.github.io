To apply for U.S. citizenship through naturalization, you follow a series of steps that begin with confirming your eligibility and end with taking the Oath of Allegiance. According to the official [USCIS 10 Steps to Naturalization](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization), the process involves preparing and submitting [Form N-400](https://www.uscis.gov/n-400), attending a biometrics appointment, passing the naturalization interview and tests, and participating in an oath ceremony. The entire process typically takes 4 to 14 months.

## Step 1: Determine if You Are Already a U.S. Citizen

Before applying, confirm that you are not already a U.S. citizen. According to [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization), some people are citizens by birth (born in the U.S. or to U.S. citizen parents) or may have acquired or derived citizenship automatically through a parent. If neither applies to you, proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Confirm Your Eligibility

According to [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship), to be eligible for naturalization you must generally:

- Be at least 18 years old
- Be a lawful permanent resident (green card holder)
- Have lived in the U.S. for at least 5 years as a permanent resident (or 3 years if married to a U.S. citizen)
- Have been physically present in the U.S. for at least 30 months out of the last 5 years (or 18 months for the 3-year path)
- Demonstrate good moral character
- Be able to read, write, and speak basic English
- Have knowledge of U.S. history and government
- Be willing to take the Oath of Allegiance

USCIS offers a free [naturalization eligibility tool](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/naturalization-eligibility-tool) to help you determine if you qualify.

## Step 3: Prepare and Submit Form N-400

[Form N-400, Application for Naturalization](https://www.uscis.gov/n-400), is the official application for U.S. citizenship. You can file it online by creating a free USCIS account or submit it by mail. The form covers your personal information, residence and employment history, travel outside the U.S., and questions about your moral character. Gather all supporting documents before you start, including your Green Card, passport, and travel records.

## Step 4: Pay the Filing Fee

Submit your filing fee along with your N-400 application. Fee waivers are available for applicants who demonstrate financial hardship, and reduced fees are available for applicants with household income at or below 400% of the federal poverty guidelines. You can pay online if you file electronically. After USCIS receives your application, they will send you a receipt notice to confirm it is being processed.

## Step 5: Attend Your Biometrics Appointment

If biometrics are required, USCIS will send you an appointment notice with the date, time, and location. At the appointment, your fingerprints, photograph, and signature will be collected for background checks. Bring the appointment notice and your Green Card.

## Step 6: Complete the Naturalization Interview and Tests

This is the most important step. According to the [USCIS naturalization interview guide](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/the-naturalization-interview-and-test), a USCIS officer will:

- Verify your identity and review your N-400 application
- Ask questions about your background, travel, and moral character
- Test your ability to read and write in English
- Administer the civics test on U.S. history and government

For the 2008 civics test, the officer asks up to 10 questions and you need 6 correct. For the 2025 civics test, the officer asks up to 20 questions and you need 12 correct. Study with the [official USCIS civics test materials](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/study-for-the-test) to prepare.

## Step 7: Receive a Decision from USCIS

After your interview, USCIS will mail you a decision notice. There are three possible outcomes:

- **Granted**: Your application is approved and you will be scheduled for an oath ceremony
- **Continued**: You need to provide additional documents or retake a test you did not pass
- **Denied**: Your application is denied based on the evidence in your record

## Step 8: Take the Oath of Allegiance

If your application is approved, you will attend a naturalization ceremony where you take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. According to [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization), you are not a U.S. citizen until you complete this oath. In some cases, you may be able to take the oath on the same day as your interview. At the ceremony, you will turn in your Green Card and receive your Certificate of Naturalization.

## Prepare for the Interview with Mock Practice

The naturalization interview is the step that requires the most preparation. You need to be ready to answer questions about your N-400, read and write English sentences, and answer civics questions about U.S. history and government out loud. Citizenry's unlimited mock interviews simulate the full USCIS interview experience, letting you practice as many times as you need until you feel confident.
