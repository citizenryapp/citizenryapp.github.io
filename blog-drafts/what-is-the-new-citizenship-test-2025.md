The new citizenship test is the 2025 Naturalization Civics Test. USCIS uses it for applicants who file Form N-400 on or after October 20, 2025. Here is what it is and how it works.

## Who Takes the 2025 Test?

Your test version depends on when you file your N-400 application for naturalization. If you file **on or after October 20, 2025**, you take the 2025 test. If you filed **before** that date, you take the 2008 test.

## What Is on the 2025 Test?

The naturalization test has two main parts: civics and English. The 2025 changes apply to the **civics** part. The **English** part (reading, writing, and speaking) is the same as before. You still read one sentence, write one sentence from dictation, and answer eligibility questions in English (unless you qualify for an English language exception).

## How the Civics Test Works

The 2025 civics test has a bank of **128 questions** on US history and government. During your interview, the officer asks you **up to 20 questions** from that bank. You must answer **at least 12 correctly** to pass (60%). The officer stops once you reach 12 correct answers or 9 incorrect answers, so you may not hear all 20.

## Special Consideration for 65/20 Applicants

If you are 65 or older and have been a lawful permanent resident for at least 20 years when you file, you get special consideration. You study only **20 specially designated questions** and are asked **10** at the interview. You need **6 correct** to pass. This smaller set is available for both the 2008 and 2025 tests; which set you get depends on your N-400 filing date.

## How the 2025 Test Differs From the 2008 Test

The table below summarizes the main differences between the two civics test versions.

| Feature | 2008 Test | 2025 Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Questions to study | 100 questions | 128 questions |
| Questions asked at interview | Up to 10 | Up to 20 |
| Correct answers to pass | 6 of 10 | 12 of 20 |

Compared to the 2008 test, the 2025 test also includes updated and expanded topics in US government and history. USCIS may update individual answers over time (for example, names of current officials); check the [USCIS Check for Test Updates](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/find-study-materials-and-resources/check-for-test-updates) page for the latest.

## How to Prepare

Practice answering the questions out loud, since the test is oral. Practicing with mock interviews helps you get used to the format and passing threshold. Citizenry includes the full 128-question 2025 set and mock interviews so you can practice until you are ready for the real thing.
