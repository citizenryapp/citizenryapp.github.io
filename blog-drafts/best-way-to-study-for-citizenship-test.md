The best way to study for the citizenship test is to use official USCIS materials in conjunction with a study app that fits your learning style, and practice answering out loud. The test is an oral interview, so your study method should include speaking, not just reading. Here is a practical approach that works for most applicants.

## Start Early and Stay Consistent

Begin studying as soon as you file Form N-400 or receive your biometrics notice. Most people need at least 1 to 3 months of regular study to feel ready. Short, daily sessions (for example, 15 to 30 minutes) work better than long cramming sessions once a week. Pick a time that fits your day and stick to it.

## Know Which Test You Are Taking

Your study plan depends on your test version. If you filed your N-400 on or after October 20, 2025, you take the 2025 civics test (128 questions, 20 asked, 12 correct to pass). If you filed before that date, you take the 2008 test (100 questions, 10 asked, 6 correct to pass). Use only the official question list for your version so you do not waste time on the wrong content.

## Use Official USCIS Materials Plus a Study App That Fits You

Start with the official USCIS materials. Beyond that, choose a study app that fits you. Your learning style, test version (2008 or 2025), and whether you want features like mock interviews or multiple languages all matter. Choose resources that match how you learn and how much time you have.

## Look for an App Without Ads

When you pick a study app, consider choosing one without ads. You learn better in a distraction-free environment. Ads interrupt your focus, break your flow when you are memorizing questions and answers, and can make short study sessions feel fragmented. An ad-free app lets you concentrate on the civics content and practice without extra noise, so your study time is more effective.

## Practice Speaking Your Answers Out Loud

The civics test is given orally. The officer asks questions and you answer verbally; there are no multiple-choice options. Reading silently is not enough. Say your answers out loud every time you study. Practice with a family member, a mirror, or an app that offers mock interviews so you get used to answering under pressure.

Studying the right content and practicing out loud are the two most important habits. Citizenry is an ad-free study app that supports both the 2008 and 2025 tests with flashcards, quizzes, and unlimited mock interviews so you can practice answering out loud just like the real interview.
