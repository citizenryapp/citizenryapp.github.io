                        <p><strong>Citizenry does not display advertisements and never will.</strong> Unlike other citizenship test apps, we believe your study experience should be distraction-free. We do not use advertising networks, we do not collect data for advertising purposes, and we do not share your information with advertisers. Your privacy and focus are our priorities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Citizenry ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile application and services.</p>

                    <p>We strive to comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), and we aim to process your data lawfully, fairly, and transparently.</p>

                    <h3>1. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h3>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Citizenry mobile application for iOS and any related services we operate (collectively, the "Services").</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>2. Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Citizenry is an educational mobile application designed to help individuals prepare for the United States citizenship naturalization test through mock interviews, study materials, and practice questions.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use our app.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>3. Information We Collect</h3>
                    
                    <h4>3.1 App Use</h4>
                    <p>Our citizenship-preparation app does not require you to create an account, and we do not ask you to enter personal details such as your name, email address, or postal address in the app.</p>
                    <p>When you use our app, certain information may be collected automatically by analytics and crash reporting services. This information may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Device identifiers (for example, device ID)</li>
                        <li>IP address and general location information (such as country or region)</li>
                        <li>App usage statistics (such as screens viewed and session duration)</li>
                        <li>Technical information about your device and operating system</li>
                        <li>Crash logs and performance data</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3.2 No Advertising</h4>
                    <p><strong>Citizenry does not display any advertisements.</strong> We do not use Google AdMob or any other advertising network. We do not collect or share Advertising IDs, and we do not track you for advertising purposes.</p>

                    <h4>3.3 App Store Purchases</h4>
                    <p>If you make a purchase or subscription through the Apple App Store, the payment is processed entirely by Apple. We receive limited information necessary to support your purchase, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An internal transaction or order ID</li>
                        <li>The product purchased</li>
                        <li>The purchase or subscription status</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not receive your full payment card details.</p>
                    <p>By using our app and making in-app purchases, you consent to our sharing of data regarding your usage and consumption of purchased content with Apple, as part of our efforts to resolve refund requests. This information may include details about how you have accessed and interacted with the purchased content. We ensure that such data sharing is done in compliance with Apple's policies and only as necessary to process your requests.</p>

                    <h4>3.4 Location Information</h4>
                    <p>Some features in our app may use your location (such as ZIP code) to provide location-specific information like your local representatives. Providing location information is optional. The app will still work if you choose not to provide it.</p>
                    <p>We do not store your precise location on our own servers.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>4. How We Use Your Information</h3>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>5. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA and UK Users)</h3>
                    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), we process your personal data under one or more of the following legal bases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> To provide the Services you request (for example, processing purchases through the App Store).</li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To maintain and improve our Services and understand how our Services are used, provided these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> For certain analytics or location-based features where required by law. You may withdraw your consent at any time.</li>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>7. International Data Transfers</h3>
                    <p>We are based in the United States. Your information may be processed in the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from those in your country of residence.</p>
                    <p>For EEA and UK data, when personal data is transferred to a country that does not provide an equivalent level of data protection, we rely on appropriate safeguards, such as the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h3>8. Data Retention</h3>

                    </ul>
