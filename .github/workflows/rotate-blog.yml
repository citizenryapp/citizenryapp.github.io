# Blog Rotation Workflow
# 
# This workflow automatically rotates blog articles to keep the content
# appearing fresh. It runs every 3-4 days and updates article dates
# to maintain the appearance of twice-weekly publishing.
#
# The rotation moves articles in a cycle, so different articles get
# featured and appear at the top of the blog over time.
