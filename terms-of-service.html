                    <h3>1. THE APPLICATION</h3>
                    <p>Citizenry ("Licensed Application") is a piece of software created to help users prepare for the US citizenship test through mock interviews and study materials — and customized for iOS mobile devices ("Devices"). It is used to practice for the naturalization interview.</p>

                    <p>The Licensed Application is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Licensed Application. You may not use the Licensed Application in a way that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).</p>

                    <h3>2. SCOPE OF LICENSE</h3>
                    <p>2.4 You may not reverse engineer, translate, disassemble, integrate, decompile, remove, modify, combine, create derivative works or updates of, adapt, or attempt to derive the source code of the Licensed Application, or any part thereof (except with Citizenry's prior written consent).</p>

                    <p>2.5 You may not copy (excluding when expressly authorized by this license and the Usage Rules) or alter the Licensed Application or portions thereof. You may create and store copies only on devices that You own or control for backup keeping under the terms of this license, the Usage Rules, and any other terms and conditions that apply to the device or software used. You may not remove any intellectual property notices. You acknowledge that no unauthorized third parties may gain access to these copies at any time. If you sell your Devices to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Devices before doing so.</p>

                    <p>2.6 Violations of the obligations mentioned above, as well as the attempt of such infringement, may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p>

                    <p>2.7 Licensor reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of licensing.</p>
