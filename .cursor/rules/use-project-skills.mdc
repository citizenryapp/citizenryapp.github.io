# Use Project Skills

When the user's request matches the scope of a skill defined in this project's **`skills/`** directory, you **must**:

1. **Identify the relevant skill**  
   Each skill lives in `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. Read the skill's front matter (name, description) to see if the user's task falls under its scope.

2. **Read the skill first**  
   Before doing the task, read the full skill file at `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` using the Read tool.

3. **Follow the skill's workflow**  
   Execute the steps and rules defined in the skill (e.g. workflow order, draft-then-build, use of references). Do not skip steps or substitute your own workflow when the skill defines one.

If no skill in `skills/` applies to the request, proceed as usual. When in doubt, list the contents of `skills/` and check each skill's description against the user's ask.
